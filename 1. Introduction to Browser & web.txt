1. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

  HTTP2 is much faster and more reliable than HTTP1.  HTTP1 loads a single request for every TCP connection, while HTTP2 avoids network delay by using multiplexing. HTTP is a network delay sensitive protocol in the sense that if there is less network delay, then the page loads faster.





2. Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript


Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value.
